# flower_recognition
because of hard covid-19 outbreak many people have to stay at home, home office, home gaming and home laying. 
The people who the whole time stay at home have no chance to enjoy the nature, i bring the nature to them with these flower pics.
after a little coding the model i trained should have the ability the different flowers and background grass to distinguish.
just like a photo below:
